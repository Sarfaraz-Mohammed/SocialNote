# social_note

To run the program, execute ```python3 my_app.py```

The login page is used to grab the data entered and verify if the username and password entered are stored in the database. If the data entered is in the database, the user can now access the rest of the features within the app. If the user is not found in the database, the system will prompt the user to register. This feature was coded by using the given template in flask and adding our own HTML and CSS elements. We organized the page in a more unique way and gave it a design by adding CSS styles to the site.

Our second feature was the register page for new users to create an account. It required them to enter their email, create a username, and enter a password twice. This feature was coded by using the given template in flask and adding our own HTML and CSS elements. We organized the page in a more unique way and gave it a design by adding CSS styles to the site. 

Our third feature was the to-do list page where the user will open an entry and fill out the field with data requested. Once the data fields like (name of task, etc) have been entered, the program will send the entry to the local database to store for later. This feature was coded using Python, flask, and local database.
